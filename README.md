== Description ==

A Simple Facebook Like Button 

I have created the Facebook Like plugin, As mine is all about the startup business and this plugin will be useful in marketing and publicity. If a visitor likes the facebook page then he will be getting the notifications of all the products and dates of the miniature exhibitions. The visitor can like the page and also get in contact with the owner directly and find-out about the bookings and the offers or can also customise the products by getting in contact with the owner.

You can also customize setting for following features:

* You can show facebook like button at the top and/or botton of content of your posts/home/pages/archive.
* You can set Facebook Like Button Align to the Left or Right of your posts/home/pages/archive.
* You can show Friend's faces under like button.
* You can set - Layout
* You can set - Size (small or large)
